# NO CHEATING!!!

A collection of the go code I have submitted as solutions to problems on
[<samp>\<code_eva\\\></samp>](https://www.codeeval.com) (I am only sort of
mimicking their logo).  You may look at this code if you want to compare with
your solutions or if you've tried your darnedest and you're stuck, but
**NO CHEATING!!!**

Also, note that I am learning, so although I am trying, I may not have
necessarily followed best practices.
